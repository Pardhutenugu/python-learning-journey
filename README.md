 # Python Learning - Day 1 🐍

## Topics Covered

- Variables  
- Data Types: `int`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`  
- Input & Output: `print()` and `input()`  
- Arithmetic Operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`  
- Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`  
- Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`  
- Strings: concatenation, repetition, indexing, slicing, methods  
- Conditional Statements: `if / else`  
- Boolean Logic: `True / False`  
- Practice Exercises  

## Notes

- Variables store data in memory.  
- Python is dynamically typed; no need to declare variable types.  
- Strings are immutable.  
- Python indices start at 0.  
- User input is always a string; convert to numbers with `int()` or `float()` if needed.  
- Conditional statements allow decision-making.  
- Boolean values are `True` or `False`.  
- Logical operators help combine conditions.  
- Practicing examples strengthens understanding.  

## Practice Exercises

1. Ask user for two numbers and print sum, difference, product, division, modulo, and exponent.  
2. Take the user’s first and last name and print a greeting.  
3. Check if a number entered by the user is even or odd.  
4. Concatenate two strings and print the result and their combined length.  
5. Use string methods (`upper()`, `lower()`, `replace()`, `capitalize()`) on user input.  
6. Write an `if/else` condition to check age eligibility.
