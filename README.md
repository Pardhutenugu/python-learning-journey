This repository contains my Python learning journey, organized by days. Each day focuses on different Python concepts, examples, and exercises.

## Folder Structure

- `day01_Basics/` : Day 1 – Basics (variables, data types, input/output, arithmetic, strings, conditionals)
- (Future days will be added similarly)
